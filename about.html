                    <p>When I think of biographies I think of complete life stories filled with excitement and adventure. But
                        that also comes with an end so I rather think of this as an introduction. My background and my identity
                        is the sole reason why I am here. Although I am very self conscious and lack confidence, I am growing
                        each and everyday with the SMASH@Wharton activities. My passions have focused on performing arts
                        and athletic festivities. If we get a chance to move around and exercise you can count me in. But
                        do not let that distract you from my love of academia and structure. Structure shapes who I am but
                        sometimes I struggle with relationships and emotions. Knowing this, I aspire to occupations that
                        deal with behavioral science. Particularly child psychology.</p>
